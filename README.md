# growbrewproxy
growbrew got leaked once (1.4) so now releasing source code cuz some skids got it someone must have told the link...
NOTE: has growbrew server/client part for chatting etc., you can remove that though.

- The first Growtopia Proxy coded in c# - not affiliated with ama6nen/enetproxy

features:
- GUI
- world parsing, has many many visuals included
- Showing players in world list
- Subserver switching
- Name Changer
- Safe vault bypass
- AAP bypass
- RGB Skin (somewhat, was too lazy to fix having too dark / light skin)
- Magplant hack (pickup range 11 blocks exploit)
- overall better and more cheats/features (it used to be a paid hack anyway, therefore has "premium quality")
- Some nuker (inspired from minecraft)
- Speed hack on all versions
- Version spoofer
- Integrated HTTP Server
- Player Manager
- Growbrew Network
- many more, might even add something soon to this open src project.

REPORT: people who bought it are saying that growbrew is slightly faster than ama's enetproxy, which is weird cuz i serialize world packet
and c++ should be faster in general, but heres proof of 1 guy saying that growbrew has a better overall performance:
